# ArucoCppDetection
A Simple c++ program that detects arucos from default camera feed. Will probably work with network streams if beat with a hammer enough.

* Install opencv:
  On Ubuntu based systems: `sudo apt install libopencv-dev` and on Arch: `sudo pacman -S opencv`
* Install cmake
* Run `cmake .` to configure
* Run `make` to build
* To run the program just run `./cvtest`
